# State-Machine for Unity
Easy-to-use state machine
## What is this?
A state machine will allow to create and manage the transition between the various states, this method is particularly used to avoid the boolean forest and to get lost in conditions which makes the code not very modular and extensible whereas with a state machine it would be enough to add a state and transitions without having to modify all the code already written
## How does it work?
a state machine will perform state changes (of a player for example) using transitions that you would define yourself 
## How to use
### How to Create a new State
You will need to create a class that inherits from BaseState
```cs
 public class ExempleState: BaseState
 {
  public ExempleState();
  public override void StartState(MonoBehavior mono)
  {
    //Do something
  }
  
  public override void UpdateState()
  {
    //Do something
  }
 }
```
## How to Create a new State Machine
here I assume that it is a state machine for a player and that you have created 3 states: IdleState, WalkState and RunState as seen before 
```cs
  public class Player : MonoBehaviour
  {
    StateMachine playerStateMachine;
    
    IdleState idle;
    WalkState walk;
    RunState run;
    
    Transition toIdle;
    Transition idleToWalk;
    Transiton walkToRun;
    
    void Start()
    {
       // here we will initialize our states
      void InitStates();
       // here we will initialise our transitions for this we will need a function that returns a boolean for each transition
      void InitTransition();
       // now that we have initialized our states and transitions we will initialize the state machine with all these 
      void InitStatesMachine();
    }
    
    void InitStates()
    {
      idle = new IdleState();
      walk = new WalkState();
      run = new RunState();
    }
    
    //you will need to create conditions to move from one state to another as follows
     bool isIdle()
    {
      return velocity == 0; // here if the velocity of the player reaches 0 the condition will be true
    }
    
    bool isWalking()
    {
      return velocity > 0 && velocity < 5; // if the velocity is between 1 and 5 the condition will be true
    }
    
    bool isRunning()
    {
      return velocity > 5; // if the velocity is greater than 5 then our character is running
    }
    /*once done you will initialize the transitions there are two constructors
    Transition(fromState, ToState, Condition) this constructor will start from a state to go to another and there is 
    Transition(ToState, Condition) which makes that state accessible from any state */
    
    void InitTransition()
    {
       // I want the idle state to be accessible from any state so I don't put an origin state but only the destination
      toIdle = new Transition(idle, isIdle);
       // now I want to be able to go from idle to walk
      idleToWalk = new Transition(idle, walk, isWalking);
       // I want to go from walking to running
      walkToRun = new Transition(walk, run, isRunning);
    }
    
    void InitStatesMachine()
    {
    /* idle will be our starting state and this refers to our MonoBehaviour
    to be able to access it in our states to be able to modify variables that are there*/
      playerStateMachine = new StateMachine(idle, this);
      
      //we will add our previously initialized states to our state machine
      playerStateMachine.AddState(idle);
      playerStateMachine.AddState(walk);
      playerStateMachine.AddState(run);
      
      //we will add our previously initialized transitions to our state machine
      playerStateMachine.AddTransition(toIdle);
      playerStateMachine.AddTransition(idleToWalk);
      playerStateMachine.AddTransition(walkToRun);
      
      playerStateMachine.Start();
    }
    
    void Update()
    {
      playerStateMachine.Update(); // this will execute the code done in the active state update
    }
   }
```

in the example there are few transitions to show how it works but in a real use case you would need for example a transition to go from running to walking as well as from walking to idle
